What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web Pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
- Lightweight language - small memory footprint, easy to implement.
- Interpreted language - no compilation, instructions executed directly.
- Object-oriented language - modeled around objects.
- First-class functions - functions as values.
- Scripting language - instructions written for a runtime environment.
- Runtime environment - browser makes a http request to server, server responds with HTML content, browser converts this HTML content into object tree (DOM), wherein JavaScript has the oppurtunity to modify the nodes of this DOM tree, to add dynamic functionality to the Web Page.

Why learn JavaScript?
- Client side web development - Native JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, Ember
- Server side web development - NodeJS, Express.
- Browser Extensions - plugins, addons.
- Desktop Applications.
- Mobile Applications.
- IoT Applications.
- JavaScript is the most loved as well as the most hated programming language.

History of JavaScript
- Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape.
- Created to complement Java.
- Designed to be "easy".
-  Standardized as ECMAScript.

Development Environment
- Web Browser (Chrome, FireFox, Safari).
- Code Editors (VS Code).

Variable Decalaration
- var value = 42;
- var value; value = 42;  

Primitives / Primitive Types
- Number - Numbers in JavaScript are "double precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values". (No Integers!).
- String
- Boolean 
-
